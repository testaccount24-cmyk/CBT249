Sam -

When we migrated from OS/390 2.5 to 2.8, this program stopped
working.  The problem was in the way it searched the DEBs of the
PDS datasets allocated to a TSO user.  This was corrected.  Since
then we've discovered a few other minor problems (not sure if they
were in the original or if I introduced them), fixed them and even
added the ability to tell you which LINK LIST SET you're running
out of if your program is in the LNKLIST.

Of all the changes though, please note that the program does more
than it used to, it works, and is considerably smaller.
